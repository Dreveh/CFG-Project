          <div class="panel">
            <p>CodeFest Girls is a 2 day festival. It will take place on Saturday 26th & Sunday 27th of August 2023. The festival grounds will open at 10am on Saturday and close to all attendees at 11:30pm on Sunday.</p>

          <button class="accordion">Is there an age limit?</button>
          <div class="panel">
           <p>There is no age limit! Anyone is welcome at CodeFest. We only ask that anyone under the age of 16 years old is accompanied by a parent or guardian. Any aspects of the event that are not suitable for junior audiences will be noted in the event description in the festival guide (we will be giving these out at the site, or you can plan your trip using our dedicated CofeFest app!)</p>

          <button class="accordion">What facilities are there for campers?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p> Anyone camping will have full use of a range of practical and comfort enhancing facilities spread across the camping area. This includes private eco compost toilets and solar powered shower cubicles. We also have a range of great pop up food trucks and stalls (so you won't have to go too far for your morning coffee!) You can find more about this on our dedicated camping options page.</p>

          <button class="accordion">What if it rains?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Given that the festival is UK-based, we must all plan with rain in mind. We are confident your enjoyment will not be reduced with a bit of rain and have made sure we have plenty of event tents with cover for those who don't enjoy the drizzle. The event will take place rain or shine.</p>
